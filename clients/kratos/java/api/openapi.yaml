        This endpoint returns a 200 status code when the HTTP server is up running.
        This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.

        If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the
        `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.

        Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never
        refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

        Use this endpoint to complete a recovery flow using the link method. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
        a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

        Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow using the link method. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` and allows the user to request another verification email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a verification link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with
        a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

            This field is only set when the session hook is configured as a post-registration hook.

            A session token is equivalent to a session cookie, but it can be sent in the HTTP Authorization
            Header:

            Authorization: bearer ${session-token}
