If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking:  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.
