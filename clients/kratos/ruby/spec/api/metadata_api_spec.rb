#Ory Kratos API

#Documentation for all public and administrative Ory Kratos APIs. Public and administrative APIs are exposed on different ports. Public APIs can face the public internet without any protection while administrative APIs should never be exposed without prior authorization. To protect the administative API port you should use something like Nginx, Ory Oathkeeper, or any other technology capable of authorizing incoming requests.

  # This endpoint returns the version of Ory Kratos.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the version will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Kratos is accepting incoming HTTP requests. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.

Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # Check HTTP Server and Database Status
  # This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Kratos is up running and the environment dependencies (e.g. the database) are responsive as well.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of Ory Kratos, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.
