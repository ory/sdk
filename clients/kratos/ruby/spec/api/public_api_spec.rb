  # unit tests for initialize_login_flow
  # Initialize a Login Flow
  # This endpoint initializes a login flow. This endpoint **should not be called from a programatic API** but instead for the, for example, browser. It will redirect the user agent (e.g. browser) to the configured login UI, appending the login challenge.  If the user-agent already has a valid authentication session, the server will respond with a 302 code redirecting to the config value of &#x60;urls.default_return_to&#x60;.
