This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  &#x60;choose_method&#x60; expects &#x60;flow&#x60; (in the URL query) and &#x60;email&#x60; (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid. and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/_*&#x60; it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended. &#x60;sent_email&#x60; is the success state after &#x60;choose_method&#x60; for the &#x60;link&#x60; method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in &#x60;choose_method&#x60; state. &#x60;passed_challenge&#x60; expects a &#x60;token&#x60; to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\&quot;sending a recovery link\&quot;) does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

        /// Create Login Flow for Browsers This endpoint initializes a browser-based user login flow. This endpoint will set the appropriate cookies and anti-CSRF measures required for browser-based flows.  If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.login.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If a valid user session exists already, the browser will be redirected to &#x60;urls.default_redirect_url&#x60; unless the query parameter &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&#x60; was set.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;session_aal1_required&#x60;: Multi-factor auth (e.g. 2fa) was requested but the user has no session yet. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!  The optional query parameter login_challenge is set when using Kratos with Hydra in an OAuth2 flow. See the oauth2_provider.url configuration option.  This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.
