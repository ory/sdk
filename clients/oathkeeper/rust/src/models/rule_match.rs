When ORY Oathkeeper searches for rules to decide what to do with an incoming request to the proxy server, it compares the full request URL (e.g. https://mydomain.com/api/resource) without query parameters of the incoming request with this field. If a match is found, the rule is considered a partial match. If the matchesMethods field is satisfied as well, the rule is considered a full match.

The following example matches all paths of the domain `mydomain.com`: `https://mydomain.com/<.*>`.
