    // > This endpoint works with all HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, ...) and matches every path prefixed with /decision.  This endpoint mirrors the proxy capability of ORY Oathkeeper's proxy functionality but instead of forwarding the request to the upstream server, returns 200 (request should be allowed), 401 (unauthorized), or 403 (forbidden) status codes. This endpoint can be used to integrate with other API Proxies like Ambassador, Kong, Envoy, and many more.

    //
    // This endpoint returns the service version typically notated using semantic versioning.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

    // This endpoint returns a 200 status code when the HTTP server is up running and the environment dependencies (e.g. the database) are responsive as well.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.
