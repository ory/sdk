  # This endpoint returns the service version typically notated using semantic versioning.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.
