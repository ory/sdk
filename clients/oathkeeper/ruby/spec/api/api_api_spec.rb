  # unit tests for decisions
  # Access Control Decision API
  # &gt; This endpoint works with all HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, ...) and matches every path prefixed with /decision.  This endpoint mirrors the proxy capability of ORY Oathkeeper&#39;s proxy functionality but instead of forwarding the request to the upstream server, returns 200 (request should be allowed), 401 (unauthorized), or 403 (forbidden) status codes. This endpoint can be used to integrate with other API Proxies like Ambassador, Kong, Envoy, and many more.

  # Retrieve a Rule
  # Use this method to retrieve a rule from the storage. If it does not exist you will receive a 404 error.

  # unit tests for get_version
  # Get Service Version
  # This endpoint returns the service version typically notated using semantic versioning.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # unit tests for get_well_known_json_web_keys

  # This endpoint returns cryptographic keys that are required to, for example, verify signatures of ID Tokens.

  # unit tests for is_instance_alive
  # Check Alive Status
  # This endpoint returns a 200 status code when the HTTP server is up running. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # unit tests for is_instance_ready
  # Check Readiness Status
  # This endpoint returns a 200 status code when the HTTP server is up running and the environment dependencies (e.g. the database) are responsive as well.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # List All Rules
  # This method returns an array of all rules that are stored in the backend. This is useful if you want to get a full view of what rules you have currently in place.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The maximum amount of rules returned.
