  # unit tests for decisions
  # Access Control Decision API
  # &gt; This endpoint works with all HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, ...) and matches every path prefixed with /decisions.  This endpoint mirrors the proxy capability of ORY Oathkeeper&#39;s proxy functionality but instead of forwarding the request to the upstream server, returns 200 (request should be allowed), 401 (unauthorized), or 403 (forbidden) status codes. This endpoint can be used to integrate with other API Proxies like Ambassador, Kong, Envoy, and many more.
