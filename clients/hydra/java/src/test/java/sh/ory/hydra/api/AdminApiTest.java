     * Accept a Consent Request
     *
     * When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, ORY Hydra asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell ORY Hydra now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you. It shows a subject interface which asks the subject to grant or deny the client access to the requested scope (\&quot;Application my-dropbox-app wants write access to all your private files\&quot;).  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider includes additional information, such as session data for access and ID tokens, and if the consent request should be used as basis for future requests.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.
