It can be enabled by an administrator.  Please note that using this endpoint you are not able to choose the &#x60;client_secret&#x60; nor the &#x60;client_id&#x60; as those values will be server generated when specifying &#x60;token_endpoint_auth_method&#x60; as &#x60;client_secret_basic&#x60; or &#x60;client_secret_post&#x60;.  The &#x60;client_secret&#x60; will be returned in the response and you will not be able to retrieve it later on. Write the secret down and keep it somewhere safe.
