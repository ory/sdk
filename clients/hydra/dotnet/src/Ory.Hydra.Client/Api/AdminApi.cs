The \&quot;Link\&quot; header is also included in successful responses, which contains one or more links for pagination, formatted like so: &#39;&lt;https://hydra-url/admin/clients?limit&#x3D;{limit}&amp;offset&#x3D;{offset}&gt;; rel&#x3D;\&quot;{page}\&quot;&#39;, where page is one of the following applicable pages: &#39;first&#39;, &#39;next&#39;, &#39;last&#39;, and &#39;previous&#39;. Multiple links can be included in this header, and will be separated by a comma.
