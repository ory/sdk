  # unit tests for accept_o_auth2_consent_request
  # Accept OAuth 2.0 Consent Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, Ory asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell Ory now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells Ory if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells Ory that the subject has authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider includes additional information, such as session data for access and ID tokens, and if the consent request should be used as basis for future requests.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.  The default consent provider is available via the Ory Managed Account Experience. To customize the consent provider, please head over to the OAuth 2.0 documentation.
