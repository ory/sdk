  # unit tests for get_version
  # Return Running Software Version.
  # This endpoint returns the version of Ory Hydra.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the version will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # Check HTTP Server Status
  # This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Hydra is accepting incoming HTTP requests. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

  # unit tests for is_ready
  # Check HTTP Server and Database Status
  # This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Hydra is up running and the environment dependencies (e.g. the database) are responsive as well.  If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the &#x60;X-Forwarded-Proto&#x60; header to be set.  Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of Ory Hydra, the health status will never refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.
