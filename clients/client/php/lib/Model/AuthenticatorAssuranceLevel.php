/**
 * AuthenticatorAssuranceLevel Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category Class
 * @description The authenticator assurance level can be one of \&quot;aal1\&quot;, \&quot;aal2\&quot;, or \&quot;aal3\&quot;. A higher number means that it is harder for an attacker to compromise the account.  Generally, \&quot;aal1\&quot; implies that one authentication factor was used while AAL2 implies that two factors (e.g. password + TOTP) have been used.  To learn more about these levels please head over to: https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/credentials
