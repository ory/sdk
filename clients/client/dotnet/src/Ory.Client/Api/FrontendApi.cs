Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking:  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the registration succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.

Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking:  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1.

If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons.

API-initiated flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors. HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/_*&#x60; respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low.  Browser flows with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie. HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.
