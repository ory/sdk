The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the login succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

API-initiated flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors. HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/_*&#x60; respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low.  Browser flows with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie. HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.  If this endpoint is called with a &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60;: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&amp;return_to&#x3D;&lt;the-current-browser-url&gt;&#x60;, or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The flow was interrupted with &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60; but apparently some other identity logged in instead. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! &#x60;browser_location_change_required&#x60;: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL. Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Settings &amp; Profile Management Documentation](../self-service/flows/user-settings).

The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you. It shows a subject interface which asks the subject to grant or deny the client access to the requested scope (\&quot;Application my-dropbox-app wants write access to all your private files\&quot;).  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has not authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider must include a reason why the consent was not granted.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.

The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you.

The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to.

        /// :::info  This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.  :::  Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and responds with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a &#x60;use_flow_id&#x60; parameter in the body; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the login succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

The login provider is an web-app you write and host, and it must be able to authenticate (\&quot;show the subject a login screen\&quot;) a subject (in OAuth2 the proper name for subject is \&quot;resource owner\&quot;).  The authentication challenge is appended to the login provider URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The login provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then accept or reject the requested authentication process.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has successfully authenticated and includes additional information such as the subject&#39;s ID and if ORY Hydra should remember the subject&#39;s subject agent for future authentication attempts by setting a cookie.  The response contains a redirect URL which the login provider should redirect the user-agent to.

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key. A JWK Set is a JSON data structure that represents a set of JWKs. A JSON Web Key is identified by its set and key id. ORY Hydra uses this functionality to store cryptographic keys used for TLS and JSON Web Tokens (such as OpenID Connect ID tokens), and allows storing user-defined keys as well.

This endpoint expects the &#x60;version&#x60; key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!

Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.  If this endpoint is called with a &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly!

If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.
