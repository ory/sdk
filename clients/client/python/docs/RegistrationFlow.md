# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RegistrationFlow from a JSON string
registration_flow_instance = RegistrationFlow.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(RegistrationFlow.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
registration_flow_dict = registration_flow_instance.to_dict()
