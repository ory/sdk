```python
from ory_client.models.identity import Identity

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Identity from a JSON string
identity_instance = Identity.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Identity.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
identity_dict = identity_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Identity from a dict
identity_form_dict = identity.from_dict(identity_dict)
