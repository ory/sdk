  # unit tests for accept_consent_request
  # Accept a Consent Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, ORY Hydra asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell ORY Hydra now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you. It shows a subject interface which asks the subject to grant or deny the client access to the requested scope (\&quot;Application my-dropbox-app wants write access to all your private files\&quot;).  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider includes additional information, such as session data for access and ID tokens, and if the consent request should be used as basis for future requests.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.

  # Accept a Login Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, ORY Hydra asks the login provider (sometimes called \&quot;identity provider\&quot;) to authenticate the subject and then tell ORY Hydra now about it. The login provider is an web-app you write and host, and it must be able to authenticate (\&quot;show the subject a login screen\&quot;) a subject (in OAuth2 the proper name for subject is \&quot;resource owner\&quot;).  The authentication challenge is appended to the login provider URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The login provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then accept or reject the requested authentication process.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has successfully authenticated and includes additional information such as the subject&#39;s ID and if ORY Hydra should remember the subject&#39;s subject agent for future authentication attempts by setting a cookie.

  # Update a JSON Web Key
  # Use this method if you do not want to let Hydra generate the JWKs for you, but instead save your own.  A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key. A JWK Set is a JSON data structure that represents a set of JWKs. A JSON Web Key is identified by its set and key id. ORY Hydra uses this functionality to store cryptographic keys used for TLS and JSON Web Tokens (such as OpenID Connect ID tokens), and allows storing user-defined keys as well.

  # Update an OAuth 2.0 Client
  # Update an existing OAuth 2.0 Client. If you pass &#x60;client_secret&#x60; the secret will be updated and returned via the API. This is the only time you will be able to retrieve the client secret, so write it down and keep it safe.  OAuth 2.0 clients are used to perform OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows. Usually, OAuth 2.0 clients are generated for applications which want to consume your OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect capabilities.
