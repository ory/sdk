  # @option opts [Integer] :per_page Deprecated Items per Page  DEPRECATED: Please use &#x60;page_token&#x60; instead. This parameter will be removed in the future.  This is the number of items per page.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page Deprecated Pagination Page  DEPRECATED: Please use &#x60;page_token&#x60; instead. This parameter will be removed in the future.  This value is currently an integer, but it is not sequential. The value is not the page number, but a reference. The next page can be any number and some numbers might return an empty list.  For example, page 2 might not follow after page 1. And even if page 3 and 5 exist, but page 4 might not exist. The first page can be retrieved by omitting this parameter. Following page pointers will be returned in the &#x60;Link&#x60; header.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size Page Size  This is the number of items per page to return. For details on pagination please head over to the [pagination documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/api-design#pagination).
  # @option opts [String] :page_token Next Page Token  The next page token. For details on pagination please head over to the [pagination documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/api-design#pagination).
  # @option opts [String] :consistency Read Consistency Level (preview)  The read consistency level determines the consistency guarantee for reads:  strong (slow): The read is guaranteed to return the most recent data committed at the start of the read. eventual (very fast): The result will return data that is about 4.8 seconds old.  The default consistency guarantee can be changed in the Ory Network Console or using the Ory CLI with &#x60;ory patch project --replace &#39;/previews/default_read_consistency_level&#x3D;\&quot;strong\&quot;&#39;&#x60;.  Setting the default consistency level to &#x60;eventual&#x60; may cause regressions in the future as we add consistency controls to more APIs. Currently, the following APIs will be affected by this setting:  &#x60;GET /admin/identities&#x60;  This feature is in preview and only available in Ory Network.  ConsistencyLevelUnset  ConsistencyLevelUnset is the unset / default consistency level. strong ConsistencyLevelStrong  ConsistencyLevelStrong is the strong consistency level. eventual ConsistencyLevelEventual  ConsistencyLevelEventual is the eventual consistency level using follower read timestamps.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :ids List of ids used to filter identities. If this list is empty, then no filter will be applied.
  # @option opts [String] :credentials_identifier CredentialsIdentifier is the identifier (username, email) of the credentials to look up using exact match. Only one of CredentialsIdentifier and CredentialsIdentifierSimilar can be used.
  # @option opts [String] :preview_credentials_identifier_similar This is an EXPERIMENTAL parameter that WILL CHANGE. Do NOT rely on consistent, deterministic behavior. THIS PARAMETER WILL BE REMOVED IN AN UPCOMING RELEASE WITHOUT ANY MIGRATION PATH.  CredentialsIdentifierSimilar is the (partial) identifier (username, email) of the credentials to look up using similarity search. Only one of CredentialsIdentifier and CredentialsIdentifierSimilar can be used.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :include_credential Include Credentials in Response  Include any credential, for example &#x60;password&#x60; or &#x60;oidc&#x60;, in the response. When set to &#x60;oidc&#x60;, This will return the initial OAuth 2.0 Access Token, OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token and the OpenID Connect ID Token if available.
