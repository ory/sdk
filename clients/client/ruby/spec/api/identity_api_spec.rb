#Ory APIs

## Introduction Documentation for all public and administrative Ory APIs. Administrative APIs can only be accessed with a valid Personal Access Token. Public APIs are mostly used in browsers.  ## SDKs This document describes the APIs available in the Ory Network. The APIs are available as SDKs for the following languages:  | Language       | Download SDK                                                     | Documentation                                                                        | | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | Dart           | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ory_client)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dart/README.md)       | | .NET           | [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ory.Client/)          | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dotnet/README.md)     | | Elixir         | [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ory_client)                     | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/elixir/README.md)     | | Go             | [github.com](https://github.com/ory/client-go)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/go/README.md)         | | Java           | [maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/sh.ory/ory-client) | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/java/README.md)       | | JavaScript     | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript/README.md) | | JavaScript (With fetch) | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client-fetch)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript-fetch/README.md) |  | PHP            | [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client)       | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/php/README.md)        | | Python         | [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/ory-client/)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/python/README.md)     | | Ruby           | [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/ory-client)             | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/ruby/README.md)       | | Rust           | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ory-client)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/rust/README.md)       |

  # Create multiple identities
  # Creates multiple [identities](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/concepts/identity-user-model).  You can also use this endpoint to [import credentials](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/manage-identities/import-user-accounts-identities), including passwords, social sign-in settings, and multi-factor authentication methods.  You can import: Up to 1,000 identities per request Up to 200 identities per request if including plaintext passwords  Avoid importing large batches with plaintext passwords. They can cause timeouts as the passwords need to be hashed before they are stored.  If at least one identity is imported successfully, the response status is 200 OK. If all imports fail, the response is one of the following 4xx errors: 400 Bad Request: The request payload is invalid or improperly formatted. 409 Conflict: Duplicate identities or conflicting data were detected.  If you get a 504 Gateway Timeout: Reduce the batch size Avoid duplicate identities Pre-hash passwords with BCrypt  If the issue persists, contact support.

  # unit tests for list_identities
  # List Identities
  # Lists all [identities](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/concepts/identity-user-model) in the system. Note: filters cannot be combined.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :per_page Deprecated Items per Page  DEPRECATED: Please use &#x60;page_token&#x60; instead. This parameter will be removed in the future.  This is the number of items per page.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page Deprecated Pagination Page  DEPRECATED: Please use &#x60;page_token&#x60; instead. This parameter will be removed in the future.  This value is currently an integer, but it is not sequential. The value is not the page number, but a reference. The next page can be any number and some numbers might return an empty list.  For example, page 2 might not follow after page 1. And even if page 3 and 5 exist, but page 4 might not exist. The first page can be retrieved by omitting this parameter. Following page pointers will be returned in the &#x60;Link&#x60; header.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size Page Size  This is the number of items per page to return. For details on pagination please head over to the [pagination documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/api-design#pagination).
  # @option opts [String] :page_token Next Page Token  The next page token. For details on pagination please head over to the [pagination documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/api-design#pagination).
  # @option opts [String] :consistency Read Consistency Level (preview)  The read consistency level determines the consistency guarantee for reads:  strong (slow): The read is guaranteed to return the most recent data committed at the start of the read. eventual (very fast): The result will return data that is about 4.8 seconds old.  The default consistency guarantee can be changed in the Ory Network Console or using the Ory CLI with &#x60;ory patch project --replace &#39;/previews/default_read_consistency_level&#x3D;\&quot;strong\&quot;&#39;&#x60;.  Setting the default consistency level to &#x60;eventual&#x60; may cause regressions in the future as we add consistency controls to more APIs. Currently, the following APIs will be affected by this setting:  &#x60;GET /admin/identities&#x60;  This feature is in preview and only available in Ory Network.  ConsistencyLevelUnset  ConsistencyLevelUnset is the unset / default consistency level. strong ConsistencyLevelStrong  ConsistencyLevelStrong is the strong consistency level. eventual ConsistencyLevelEventual  ConsistencyLevelEventual is the eventual consistency level using follower read timestamps.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :ids Retrieve multiple identities by their IDs.  This parameter has the following limitations:  Duplicate or non-existent IDs are ignored. The order of returned IDs may be different from the request. This filter does not support pagination. You must implement your own pagination as the maximum number of items returned by this endpoint may not exceed a certain threshold (currently 500).
  # @option opts [String] :credentials_identifier CredentialsIdentifier is the identifier (username, email) of the credentials to look up using exact match. Only one of CredentialsIdentifier and CredentialsIdentifierSimilar can be used.
  # @option opts [String] :preview_credentials_identifier_similar This is an EXPERIMENTAL parameter that WILL CHANGE. Do NOT rely on consistent, deterministic behavior. THIS PARAMETER WILL BE REMOVED IN AN UPCOMING RELEASE WITHOUT ANY MIGRATION PATH.  CredentialsIdentifierSimilar is the (partial) identifier (username, email) of the credentials to look up using similarity search. Only one of CredentialsIdentifier and CredentialsIdentifierSimilar can be used.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :include_credential Include Credentials in Response  Include any credential, for example &#x60;password&#x60; or &#x60;oidc&#x60;, in the response. When set to &#x60;oidc&#x60;, This will return the initial OAuth 2.0 Access Token, OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token and the OpenID Connect ID Token if available.
