  # unit tests for create_json_web_key_set
  # Create JSON Web Key
  # This endpoint is capable of generating JSON Web Key Sets for you. There a different strategies available, such as symmetric cryptographic keys (HS256, HS512) and asymetric cryptographic keys (RS256, ECDSA). If the specified JSON Web Key Set does not exist, it will be created.  A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key. A JWK Set is a JSON data structure that represents a set of JWKs. A JSON Web Key is identified by its set and key id. ORY Hydra uses this functionality to store cryptographic keys used for TLS and JSON Web Tokens (such as OpenID Connect ID tokens), and allows storing user-defined keys as well.
