#Ory APIs

## Introduction Documentation for all public and administrative Ory APIs. Administrative APIs can only be accessed with a valid Personal Access Token. Public APIs are mostly used in browsers.  ## SDKs This document describes the APIs available in the Ory Network. The APIs are available as SDKs for the following languages:  | Language       | Download SDK                                                     | Documentation                                                                        | | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | Dart           | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ory_client)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dart/README.md)       | | .NET           | [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ory.Client/)          | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dotnet/README.md)     | | Elixir         | [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ory_client)                     | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/elixir/README.md)     | | Go             | [github.com](https://github.com/ory/client-go)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/go/README.md)         | | Java           | [maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/sh.ory/ory-client) | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/java/README.md)       | | JavaScript     | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript/README.md) | | JavaScript (With fetch) | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client-fetch)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript-fetch/README.md) |  | PHP            | [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client)       | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/php/README.md)        | | Python         | [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/ory-client/)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/python/README.md)     | | Ruby           | [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/ory-client)             | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/ruby/README.md)       | | Rust           | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ory-client)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/rust/README.md)       |

  # unit tests for accept_o_auth2_consent_request
  # Accept OAuth 2.0 Consent Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, Ory asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell Ory now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells Ory if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells Ory that the subject has authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider includes additional information, such as session data for access and ID tokens, and if the consent request should be used as basis for future requests.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.  The default consent provider is available via the Ory Managed Account Experience. To customize the consent provider, please head over to the OAuth 2.0 documentation.

  # unit tests for set_o_auth2_client
  # Set OAuth 2.0 Client
  # Replaces an existing OAuth 2.0 Client with the payload you send. If you pass &#x60;client_secret&#x60; the secret is used, otherwise the existing secret is used.  If set, the secret is echoed in the response. It is not possible to retrieve it later on.  OAuth 2.0 Clients are used to perform OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows. Usually, OAuth 2.0 clients are generated for applications which want to consume your OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect capabilities.
