  # unit tests for discover_open_id_configuration
  # OpenID Connect Discovery
  # The well known endpoint an be used to retrieve information for OpenID Connect clients. We encourage you to not roll your own OpenID Connect client but to use an OpenID Connect client library instead. You can learn more on this flow at https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html .  Popular libraries for OpenID Connect clients include oidc-client-js (JavaScript), go-oidc (Golang), and others. For a full list of clients go here: https://openid.net/developers/certified/

  # unit tests for dynamic_client_registration_create_o_auth2_client
  # Register an OAuth 2.0 Client using the OpenID / OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol
  # This endpoint behaves like the administrative counterpart (&#x60;createOAuth2Client&#x60;) but is capable of facing the public internet directly and can be used in self-service. It implements the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration Protocol. This feature needs to be enabled in the configuration. This endpoint is disabled by default. It can be enabled by an administrator.  Please note that using this endpoint you are not able to choose the &#x60;client_secret&#x60; nor the &#x60;client_id&#x60; as those values will be server generated when specifying &#x60;token_endpoint_auth_method&#x60; as &#x60;client_secret_basic&#x60; or &#x60;client_secret_post&#x60;.  The &#x60;client_secret&#x60; will be returned in the response and you will not be able to retrieve it later on. Write the secret down and keep it somewhere safe.

It implements the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration Protocol. This feature needs to be enabled in the configuration. This endpoint is disabled by default.

If it uses &#x60;client_secret_basic&#x60;, present the Client ID and the Client Secret in the Authorization header.  OAuth 2.0 clients are used to perform OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows. Usually, OAuth 2.0 clients are generated for applications which want to consume your OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect capabilities.

  # unit tests for oauth2_token
  # The OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint
  # The client makes a request to the token endpoint by sending the following parameters using the \&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\&quot; HTTP request entity-body.  &gt; Do not implement a client for this endpoint yourself. Use a library. There are many libraries &gt; available for any programming language. You can find a list of libraries here: https://oauth.net/code/ &gt; &gt; Do note that Hydra SDK does not implement this endpoint properly. Use one of the libraries listed above!

  # Revoke OAuth2 Tokens
  # Revoking a token (both access and refresh) means that the tokens will be invalid. A revoked access token can no longer be used to make access requests, and a revoked refresh token can no longer be used to refresh an access token. Revoking a refresh token also invalidates the access token that was created with it. A token may only be revoked by the client the token was generated for.

In the case of authentication error, a WWW-Authenticate header might be set in the response with more information about the error.
