  # When accessing this endpoint through Ory Kratos&#39; Public API you must ensure that either the Ory Kratos Session Cookie or the Ory Kratos Session Token are set.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  You can access this endpoint without credentials when using Ory Kratos&#39; Admin API.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The flow was interrupted with &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60; but apparently some other identity logged in instead.

If this endpoint is called with a &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60;: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&amp;return_to&#x3D;&lt;the-current-browser-url&gt;&#x60;, or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The flow was interrupted with &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60; but apparently some other identity logged in instead. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! &#x60;browser_location_change_required&#x60;: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL. Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Settings &amp; Profile Management Documentation](../self-service/flows/user-settings).
  # @param flow The Settings Flow ID  The value for this parameter comes from &#x60;flow&#x60; URL Query parameter sent to your application (e.g. &#x60;/settings?flow&#x3D;abcde&#x60;).

  # unit tests for submit_self_service_verification_flow
  # Complete Verification Flow
  # Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  &#x60;choose_method&#x60; expects &#x60;flow&#x60; (in the URL query) and &#x60;email&#x60; (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/*&#x60; it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended. &#x60;sent_email&#x60; is the success state after &#x60;choose_method&#x60; when using the &#x60;link&#x60; method and allows the user to request another verification email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in &#x60;choose_method&#x60; state. &#x60;passed_challenge&#x60; expects a &#x60;token&#x60; to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\&quot;sending a verification link\&quot;) does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos Email and Phone Verification Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/selfservice/flows/verify-email-account-activation).
  # @param flow The Verification Flow ID  The value for this parameter comes from &#x60;flow&#x60; URL Query parameter sent to your application (e.g. &#x60;/verification?flow&#x3D;abcde&#x60;).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :token Verification Token  The verification token which completes the verification request. If the token is invalid (e.g. expired) an error will be shown to the end-user.  This parameter is usually set in a link and not used by any direct API call.

  # unit tests for to_session
  # Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To
  # Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :x_session_token Set the Session Token when calling from non-browser clients. A session token has a format of &#x60;MP2YWEMeM8MxjkGKpH4dqOQ4Q4DlSPaj&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :cookie Set the Cookie Header. This is especially useful when calling this endpoint from a server-side application. In that scenario you must include the HTTP Cookie Header which originally was included in the request to your server. An example of a session in the HTTP Cookie Header is: &#x60;ory_kratos_session&#x3D;a19iOVAbdzdgl70Rq1QZmrKmcjDtdsviCTZx7m9a9yHIUS8Wa9T7hvqyGTsLHi6Qifn2WUfpAKx9DWp0SJGleIn9vh2YF4A16id93kXFTgIgmwIOvbVAScyrx7yVl6bPZnCx27ec4WQDtaTewC1CpgudeDV2jQQnSaCP6ny3xa8qLH-QUgYqdQuoA_LF1phxgRCUfIrCLQOkolX5nv3ze_f&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;.  It is ok if more than one cookie are included here as all other cookies will be ignored.
