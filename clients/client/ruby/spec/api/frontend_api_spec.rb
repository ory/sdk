#Ory APIs

## Introduction Documentation for all public and administrative Ory APIs. Administrative APIs can only be accessed with a valid Personal Access Token. Public APIs are mostly used in browsers.  ## SDKs This document describes the APIs available in the Ory Network. The APIs are available as SDKs for the following languages:  | Language       | Download SDK                                                     | Documentation                                                                        | | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | Dart           | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ory_client)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dart/README.md)       | | .NET           | [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ory.Client/)          | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dotnet/README.md)     | | Elixir         | [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ory_client)                     | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/elixir/README.md)     | | Go             | [github.com](https://github.com/ory/client-go)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/go/README.md)         | | Java           | [maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/sh.ory/ory-client) | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/java/README.md)       | | JavaScript     | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript/README.md) | | JavaScript (With fetch) | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client-fetch)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript-fetch/README.md) |  | PHP            | [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client)       | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/php/README.md)        | | Python         | [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/ory-client/)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/python/README.md)     | | Ruby           | [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/ory-client)             | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/ruby/README.md)       | | Rust           | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ory-client)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/rust/README.md)       |

  # unit tests for create_browser_login_flow
  # Create Login Flow for Browsers
  # This endpoint initializes a browser-based user login flow. This endpoint will set the appropriate cookies and anti-CSRF measures required for browser-based flows.  If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.login.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If a valid user session exists already, the browser will be redirected to &#x60;urls.default_redirect_url&#x60; unless the query parameter &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&#x60; was set.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;session_aal1_required&#x60;: Multi-factor auth (e.g. 2fa) was requested but the user has no session yet. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!  The optional query parameter login_challenge is set when using Kratos with Hydra in an OAuth2 flow. See the oauth2_provider.url configuration option.  This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Login](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-login) and [User Registration Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-registration).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Boolean] :refresh Refresh a login session  If set to true, this will refresh an existing login session by asking the user to sign in again. This will reset the authenticated_at time of the session.
  # @option opts [String] :aal Request a Specific AuthenticationMethod Assurance Level  Use this parameter to upgrade an existing session&#39;s authenticator assurance level (AAL). This allows you to ask for multi-factor authentication. When an identity sign in using e.g. username+password, the AAL is 1. If you wish to \&quot;upgrade\&quot; the session&#39;s security by asking the user to perform TOTP / WebAuth/ ... you would set this to \&quot;aal2\&quot;.
  # @option opts [String] :return_to The URL to return the browser to after the flow was completed.
  # @option opts [String] :cookie HTTP Cookies  When using the SDK in a browser app, on the server side you must include the HTTP Cookie Header sent by the client to your server here. This ensures that CSRF and session cookies are respected.
  # @option opts [String] :login_challenge An optional Hydra login challenge. If present, Kratos will cooperate with Ory Hydra to act as an OAuth2 identity provider.  The value for this parameter comes from &#x60;login_challenge&#x60; URL Query parameter sent to your application (e.g. &#x60;/login?login_challenge&#x3D;abcde&#x60;).
  # @option opts [String] :organization An optional organization ID that should be used for logging this user in. This parameter is only effective in the Ory Network.
  # @option opts [String] :via Via should contain the identity&#39;s credential the code should be sent to. Only relevant in aal2 flows.  DEPRECATED: This field is deprecated.

  # Create a Logout URL for Browsers
  # This endpoint initializes a browser-based user logout flow and a URL which can be used to log out the user.  This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for API clients and only works with browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...). For API clients you can call the &#x60;/self-service/logout/api&#x60; URL directly with the Ory Session Token.  The URL is only valid for the currently signed in user. If no user is signed in, this endpoint returns a 401 error.  When calling this endpoint from a backend, please ensure to properly forward the HTTP cookies.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :cookie HTTP Cookies  If you call this endpoint from a backend, please include the original Cookie header in the request.

  # Create Recovery Flow for Browsers
  # This endpoint initializes a browser-based account recovery flow. Once initialized, the browser will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.recovery.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If a valid user session exists, the browser is returned to the configured return URL.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the recovery flow without any redirects or a 400 bad request error if the user is already authenticated.  This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos Account Recovery Documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery).

  # unit tests for create_browser_registration_flow
  # Create Registration Flow for Browsers
  # This endpoint initializes a browser-based user registration flow. This endpoint will set the appropriate cookies and anti-CSRF measures required for browser-based flows.  If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.registration.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If a valid user session exists already, the browser will be redirected to &#x60;urls.default_redirect_url&#x60;.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :return_to The URL to return the browser to after the flow was completed.
  # @option opts [String] :login_challenge Ory OAuth 2.0 Login Challenge.  If set will cooperate with Ory OAuth2 and OpenID to act as an OAuth2 server / OpenID Provider.  The value for this parameter comes from &#x60;login_challenge&#x60; URL Query parameter sent to your application (e.g. &#x60;/registration?login_challenge&#x3D;abcde&#x60;).  This feature is compatible with Ory Hydra when not running on the Ory Network.
  # @option opts [String] :after_verification_return_to The URL to return the browser to after the verification flow was completed.  After the registration flow is completed, the user will be sent a verification email. Upon completing the verification flow, this URL will be used to override the default &#x60;selfservice.flows.verification.after.default_redirect_to&#x60; value.
  # @option opts [String] :organization An optional organization ID that should be used to register this user. This parameter is only effective in the Ory Network.

  # unit tests for create_browser_settings_flow
  # Create Settings Flow for Browsers
  # This endpoint initializes a browser-based user settings flow. Once initialized, the browser will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If no valid Ory Kratos Session Cookie is included in the request, a login flow will be initialized.  If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url&#x60; with the flow ID set as the query parameter &#x60;?flow&#x3D;&#x60;. If no valid user session was set, the browser will be redirected to the login endpoint.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the settings flow without any redirects or a 401 forbidden error if no valid session was set.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.

  # unit tests for create_native_login_flow
  # Create Login Flow for Native Apps
  # This endpoint initiates a login flow for native apps that do not use a browser, such as mobile devices, smart TVs, and so on.  If a valid provided session cookie or session token is provided, a 400 Bad Request error will be returned unless the URL query parameter &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&#x60; is set.  To fetch an existing login flow call &#x60;/self-service/login/flows?flow&#x3D;&lt;flow_id&gt;&#x60;.

  # Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When using a token template, the token is included in the &#x60;tokenized&#x60; field of the session.  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;, { tokenize_as: \&quot;example-jwt-template\&quot; })  console.log(session.tokenized) // The JWT &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking:  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cookie or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

  # unit tests for update_login_flow
  # Submit a Login Flow
  # Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the login succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.

For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid. and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/*&#x60; it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended. &#x60;sent_email&#x60; is the success state after &#x60;choose_method&#x60; for the &#x60;link&#x60; method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in &#x60;choose_method&#x60; state. &#x60;passed_challenge&#x60; expects a &#x60;token&#x60; to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\&quot;sending a recovery link\&quot;) does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos Account Recovery Documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery).
  # @param flow The Recovery Flow ID  The value for this parameter comes from &#x60;flow&#x60; URL Query parameter sent to your application (e.g. &#x60;/recovery?flow&#x3D;abcde&#x60;).

  # Update Registration Flow
  # Use this endpoint to complete a registration flow by sending an identity&#39;s traits and password. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the created identity success - if the session hook is configured the &#x60;session&#x60; and &#x60;session_token&#x60; will also be included; HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a &#x60;use_flow_id&#x60; parameter in the body; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the registration succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! &#x60;browser_location_change_required&#x60;: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL. Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

  # Complete Settings Flow
  # Use this endpoint to complete a settings flow by sending an identity&#39;s updated password. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API-initiated flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors. HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/*&#x60; respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when &#x60;selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age&#x60; was reached or the session&#39;s AAL is too low.  Browser flows with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie. HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session&#39;s AAL is too low. HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.  If this endpoint is called with a &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60;: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters &#x60;?refresh&#x3D;true&amp;return_to&#x3D;&lt;the-current-browser-url&gt;&#x60;, or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The flow was interrupted with &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60; but apparently some other identity logged in instead. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! &#x60;browser_location_change_required&#x60;: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
