  # unit tests for patch_project
  # Patch an Ory Network Project Configuration
  # Deprecated: Use the &#x60;patchProjectWithRevision&#x60; endpoint instead to specify the exact revision the patch was generated for.  This endpoints allows you to patch individual Ory Network project configuration keys for Ory&#39;s services (identity, permission, ...). The configuration format is fully compatible with the open source projects for the respective services (e.g. Ory Kratos for Identity, Ory Keto for Permissions).  This endpoint expects the &#x60;version&#x60; key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!  While this endpoint is able to process all configuration items related to features (e.g. password reset), it does not support operational configuration items (e.g. port, tracing, logging) otherwise available in the open source.  For configuration items that can not be translated to the Ory Network, this endpoint will return a list of warnings to help you understand which parts of your config could not be processed.
