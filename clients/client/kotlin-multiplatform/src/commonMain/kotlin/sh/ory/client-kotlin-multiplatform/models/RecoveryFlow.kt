/**
 * This request is used when an identity wants to recover their account.  We recommend reading the [Account Recovery Documentation](../self-service/flows/password-reset-account-recovery)
 *
 * @param expiresAt ExpiresAt is the time (UTC) when the request expires. If the user still wishes to update the setting, a new request has to be initiated.
 * @param id ID represents the request's unique ID. When performing the recovery flow, this represents the id in the recovery ui's query parameter: http://<selfservice.flows.recovery.ui_url>?request=<id>
 * @param issuedAt IssuedAt is the time (UTC) when the request occurred.
 * @param requestUrl RequestURL is the initial URL that was requested from Ory Kratos. It can be used to forward information contained in the URL's path or query for example.
 * @param state State represents the state of this request:  choose_method: ask the user to choose a method (e.g. recover account via email) sent_email: the email has been sent to the user passed_challenge: the request was successful and the recovery challenge was passed.
 * @param type The flow type can either be `api` or `browser`.
 * @param ui 
 * @param active Active, if set, contains the recovery method that is being used. It is initially not set.
 * @param continueWith Contains possible actions that could follow this flow
 * @param returnTo ReturnTo contains the requested return_to URL.
 * @param transientPayload TransientPayload is used to pass data from the recovery flow to hooks and email templates
