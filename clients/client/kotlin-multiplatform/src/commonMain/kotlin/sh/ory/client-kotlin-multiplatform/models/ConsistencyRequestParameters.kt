/**
 * Control API consistency guarantees
 *
 * @param consistency Read Consistency Level (preview)  The read consistency level determines the consistency guarantee for reads:  strong (slow): The read is guaranteed to return the most recent data committed at the start of the read. eventual (very fast): The result will return data that is about 4.8 seconds old.  The default consistency guarantee can be changed in the Ory Network Console or using the Ory CLI with `ory patch project --replace '/previews/default_read_consistency_level=\"strong\"'`.  Setting the default consistency level to `eventual` may cause regressions in the future as we add consistency controls to more APIs. Currently, the following APIs will be affected by this setting:  `GET /admin/identities`  This feature is in preview and only available in Ory Network.  ConsistencyLevelUnset  ConsistencyLevelUnset is the unset / default consistency level. strong ConsistencyLevelStrong  ConsistencyLevelStrong is the strong consistency level. eventual ConsistencyLevelEventual  ConsistencyLevelEventual is the eventual consistency level using follower read timestamps.
