 * # Introduction Documentation for all public and administrative Ory APIs. Administrative APIs can only be accessed with a valid Personal Access Token. Public APIs are mostly used in browsers.  ## SDKs This document describes the APIs available in the Ory Network. The APIs are available as SDKs for the following languages:  | Language       | Download SDK                                                     | Documentation                                                                        | | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | Dart           | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ory_client)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dart/README.md)       | | .NET           | [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ory.Client/)          | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/dotnet/README.md)     | | Elixir         | [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ory_client)                     | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/elixir/README.md)     | | Go             | [github.com](https://github.com/ory/client-go)                   | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/go/README.md)         | | Java           | [maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/sh.ory/ory-client) | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/java/README.md)       | | JavaScript     | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript/README.md) | | JavaScript (With fetch) | [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client-fetch)           | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/typescript-fetch/README.md) |  | PHP            | [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client)       | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/php/README.md)        | | Python         | [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/ory-client/)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/python/README.md)     | | Ruby           | [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/ory-client)             | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/ruby/README.md)       | | Rust           | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ory-client)                 | [README](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/clients/client/rust/README.md)       |

    /// For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.  A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.  A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](https://stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](https://stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status unchanged.  If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings).  If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
