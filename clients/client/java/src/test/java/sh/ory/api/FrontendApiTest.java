     * Get Verification Flow
     *
     * This endpoint returns a verification flow&#39;s context with, for example, error details and other information.  Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request&#39;s HTTP Cookie Header. For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.  If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/recovery&#39;, async function (req, res) { const flow &#x3D; await client.getVerificationFlow(req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;), req.query[&#39;flow&#39;])  res.render(&#39;verification&#39;, flow) })  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos Email and Phone Verification Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/selfservice/flows/verify-email-account-activation).

When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking:  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons.

If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.
