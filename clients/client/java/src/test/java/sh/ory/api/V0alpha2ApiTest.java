The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the registration succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!
