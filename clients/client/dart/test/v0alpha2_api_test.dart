For configuration items that can not be translated to Ory Cloud, this endpoint will return a list of warnings to help you understand which parts of your config could not be processed.

    // Submit a Login Flow
    //
    // :::info  This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.  :::  Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and responds with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the login succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:  `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in. `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! `browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL. Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

    // Complete Self-Service Logout
    //
    // This endpoint logs out an identity in a self-service manner.  If the `Accept` HTTP header is not set to `application/json`, the browser will be redirected (HTTP 303 See Other) to the `return_to` parameter of the initial request or fall back to `urls.default_return_to`.  If the `Accept` HTTP header is set to `application/json`, a 204 No Content response will be sent on successful logout instead.  This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for API clients and only works with browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...). For API clients you can call the `/self-service/logout/api` URL directly with the Ory Session Token.

    // Complete Recovery Flow
    //
    // Use this endpoint to complete a recovery flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid. and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended. `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state. `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\"sending a recovery link\") does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

    // Use this endpoint to complete a registration flow by sending an identity's traits and password. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the created identity success - if the session hook is configured the `session` and `session_token` will also be included; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh registration flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the registration succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect.

    // Complete Settings Flow
    //
    // Use this endpoint to complete a settings flow by sending an identity's updated password. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API-initiated flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors. HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.  Browser flows with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie. HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session's AAL is too low. HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.  If this endpoint is called with a `Accept: application/json` HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:  `session_refresh_required`: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters `?refresh=true&return_to=<the-current-browser-url>`, or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise. `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. `session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. `security_identity_mismatch`: The flow was interrupted with `session_refresh_required` but apparently some other identity logged in instead. `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration! `browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL. Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Settings & Profile Management Documentation](../self-service/flows/user-settings).

    // Complete Verification Flow

For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended. `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state. `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\"sending a verification link\") does not have any API capabilities.

    // Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To
    //
    // Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  ```js pseudo-code example router.get('/protected-endpoint', async function (req, res) { const session = await client.toSession(undefined, req.header('cookie'))  console.log(session) }) ```  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  ```js pseudo-code example ... const session = await client.toSession(\"the-session-token\")  console.log(session) ```  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking  if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:  `session_inactive`: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). `session_aal2_required`: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

    // This endpoints allows you to update the Ory Cloud Project configuration for individual services (identity, permission, ...). The configuration is fully compatible with the open source projects for the respective services (e.g. Ory Kratos for Identity, Ory Keto for Permissions).  This endpoint expects the `version` key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!  While this endpoint is able to process all configuration items related to features (e.g. password reset), it does not support operational configuration items (e.g. port, tracing, logging) otherwise available in the open source.
