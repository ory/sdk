For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended. `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state. `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\"sending a recovery link\") does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` respond with a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 302 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 302 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.  Browser flows with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success; HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session's AAL is too low. HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

    // Complete Verification Flow
    //
    // Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/_*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended. `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state. `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\"sending a verification link\") does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

    // Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To
    //
    // Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  ```js pseudo-code example router.get('/protected-endpoint', async function (req, res) { const session = await client.toSession(undefined, req.header('cookie'))  console.log(session) }) ```  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  ```js pseudo-code example ... const session = await client.toSession(\"the-session-token\")  console.log(session) ```  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking  if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.
