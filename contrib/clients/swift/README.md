# Ory Swift SDK

Documentation for all public and administrative Ory APIs. Administrative APIs can only be accessed with a valid Personal Access Token. Public APIs are mostly used in browsers.


This package is atomatically generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator)

## Installation

Add the package dependency in your Package.swift:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ory/client-swift", from: "1.0.0"),
```

Next, in your target, add OryClient to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OryCLient", package: "OryClient"),
]),
```



## Usage

When creating an Ory client, use CustomDateTranscoder to support date with internet date time and fractional seconds.

```swift
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIURLSession
import Foundation

let serverURL = URL(string: "https://{your-project-slug}.projects.oryapis.com")
let customDateTranscoder = CustomDateTranscoder()
let transport = URLSessionTransport()

let oryClient = Client(serverURL: serverURL!,
    configuration: Configuration(dateTranscoder: customDateTranscoder),
    transport: transport)

let response = try await oryClient.createNativeLoginFlow()
print(try response.ok)
```
